      <h1 className="title_text"><a id="anchor_about"></a>About Me </h1>
      <h1 className="about_title">An Overview... </h1>
      <p className="content_text">
      I am a software-engineer with technical support and sales background in the electronics and cellular industry.
      <br/>
      I am driven by continuous improvement and complex problem-solving.
      <br/>
      Drawing from my experiences, I effectively uncover root problems  with empathy and communicate abstract solutions in a concrete way that inspires confidence and understanding.
      </p>
      <h1 className="about_title">Techy Origins...</h1>
      <p className="content_text">From the time I took apart a broken VCR and fixed it, so that I could watch my “Fellowship of the Ring” in my own room until now, I have always loved figuring what made the world tick.</p>
      <p className="content_text">Cue my first <em>big boy job</em> fixing flip hinges and replacing screens for a cellular company. Over the years, I continually adapted to the rapidly changing industry. I went from hardware repair to troubleshooting software, to direct user support, and even teaching a smart device class for senior citizens in my community.</p>
      <p className="content_text">Over time, my interests shifted to software. I kept asking myself,<br/>
      <em>Where did this come from?</em> <br/>
      <em>If I developed this, how would I approach it?</em><br/>
      <em>What could I improve?</em></p>
      <p className="content_text">I made the leap and took the Software Engineering Immersive course at <em>General Assembly</em>. Now I am catapulting forward into new exciting aspects of developing every single day.</p>


      <h1 className="about_title">On a personal note...</h1>
      <p className="content_text">Aside from a developer, I am a husband and father living. My passion hobby is theater. I am a playwright, director, and actor. It is fun, but I have gained so many transferrable skills in teater. I have learned how to effectively work with a diverse group to deliver the best possible product. I have learned the importance of giving my best to my areas of contribution. I have learned the process of taking an abstract concept and transforming it into a tangible product for the audience to enjoy.</p>
