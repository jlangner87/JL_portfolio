      <h1 className="title_text"><a id="anchor_about"></a>About Me </h1>
      <h1 className="about_title">My Brand... </h1>
      <p className="content_text">
      I am a software-engineer with technical support and sales background in the electronics and cellular industry.
      <br/>
      I am driven by continuous improvement and complex problem-solving.
      <br/>
      Drawing from my experiences, I effectively uncover root problems  with empathy and communicate abstract solutions in a concrete way that inspires confidence and understanding.
      </p>
      <h1 className="about_title">The Origin story...</h1>
      <p className="content_text">From the time I took apart a broken VCR and fixed it, so that I could watch my “Fellowship of the Ring” in my own room until now, I have always loved figuring what made the world tick.</p>
      <p className="content_text">Cue my first <em>big boy job</em> fixing flip hinges and replacing screens for a cellular company. Over the years, I continually adapted to the rapidly changing industry. I went from hardware repair to troubleshooting software, to direct user support, and even teaching a smart device class for senior citizens in my community.</p>
      <p className="content_text">Over time, my interests shifted to software. I kept asking myself,<br/>
      <em>Where did this come from?</em> <br/>
      <em>If I developed this, how would I approach it?</em><br/>
      <em>What could I improve?</em></p>
      <p className="content_text">I made the leap and took the Software Engineering Immersive course at <em>General Assembly</em>. Now I am catapulting forward into new exciting aspects of developing every single day.</p>


      <h1 className="about_title">On a personal note...</h1>
      <p className="content_text">Aside from a developer, I am a husband and father living. My passion hobby is theater. I am a playwright, director, and actor. It is fun, but I have gained so many transferrable skills in teater. I have learned how to effectively work with a diverse group to deliver the best possible product. I have learned the importance of giving my best to my areas of contribution. I have learned the process of taking an abstract concept and transforming it into a tangible product for the audience to enjoy.</p>

      <h1 className="about_title">An Octopus Philosophy...</h1>
      <p className="about_title2">Be Versatile</p>
      <p className="content_text">
        The octopus can change its shape or color to match any environment—it is able to adjust to and handle even the most challenging situations <br/>
        <em>When faced with a challenge, keep your head up and know that you already have what it takes to adapt and overcome.</em>
      </p>
      <p className="about_title2">Be Resourceful</p>
      <p className="content_text">
        The octopus is continually learning. They learn by encountering obstacles. They explore the obstacle, discover a solution, and then keep that knowledge to be built upon when facing future obstacles. <br/>
        <em>See each obstacle as an opportunity to learn. When you do not know how, use your past experiences and all available resources to learn how. </em></p>
        <p className="about_title2">Be Attentive</p>
      <p className="content_text">
      The octopus’s tentacles are an extension of its brain. They are hardwired with millions of neurons. It is continuously feeling the environment and updating its perspective. <br/>
      <em>Pay attention. Anticipate change. There are clues everywhere, telling us how to prevent or fix any problem. </em></p>
      <p className="about_title2">Be Resilient</p>
      <p className="content_text">
        The octopus faces many dangers, but it has an amazing survival mechanism. It can regenerate lost limbs. When attacked, the octopus does not give up and die. It heals and goes on living.<br/>
        <em>When things get really hard&#8212;When you meet failure, do not quit. Get up. Keep going.</em></p>
